# Marginal Effective Tax Rate (METR)
This repository calculates METR for different countries based on their statutory tax and other economic parameters. This is an important parameter that estimates the overall burden of taxes on physical investment. This (together with the Average Effective Tax Rate - EETR) is a critical parameter that is used to summarize the investment attractiveness of a country. The tax and economic parameters for each country are provided by an Excel file which can be modified as needed. The python file METR.py calculates the METR for Plant and Machinery, Building, Inventory and Land. Using the asset weights for Manufacturing and Services it then calculates the overall METR for these sectors. It can easily be extended to other sectors It uses the King-Fullerton model for calculating METRs. The output is the METR for different countries in a csv file. This model will be extended to calculate the AETR using the Devereux-Griffiths approach.
